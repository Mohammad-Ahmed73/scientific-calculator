**Project Description: Scientific Calculator with GUI in Java**

The goal of this project is to create a scientific calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java. The calculator will provide advanced mathematical functions and operations beyond the basic arithmetic calculations.

**Key Features:**

GUI Interface: The calculator will have a user-friendly interface with buttons, text fields, and display areas to input and output calculations.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers.
Scientific Functions: The calculator will include a range of scientific functions such as square root, power, logarithm, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), and exponential functions and addition function is to calculate fibonacci series and factorial.

**Technical Implementation:**

Java Programming Language: The calculator will be developed using Java to leverage its object-oriented features and libraries.
GUI Framework: Java Swing or JavaFX can be used to create the graphical user interface components, including buttons, text fields, and display areas.
Event Handling: The calculator will respond to user interactions, such as button clicks, using event-driven programming techniques.
Mathematical Functions: Java's Math library can be utilized to implement the scientific functions and operations required by the calculator.
Data Structures: Data structures like stacks may be used to handle parentheses and perform calculations accurately.
Overall, this project aims to create a user-friendly scientific calculator with a GUI using Java, providing a range of mathematical functions and operations beyond basic arithmetic. The calculator will be intuitive, accurate, and capable of handling complex calculations, making it a valuable tool for scientific and mathematical tasks.
